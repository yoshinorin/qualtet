get:
  summary: Get a series
  description: |
    Retrieves a series by its `path`. The response includes detailed information about the series including its title, description, and a list of associated articles. This endpoint returns a complete series detail model with all articles that belong to the series. The articles are sorted by their published date in descending order.

    **NOTE:** Since `v2.18.0`, it retrieves by `path` instead of by `name`. This is effectively a breaking change.
